        <p class='describe0 mt-5'>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.</p>

It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
